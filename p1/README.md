## Game planning
+ _Create an array of three options: rock, paper or scissor._
+ _Assign a variable that randomly selects what option each Player draws._
+ _Assign a variable for who the winner will be._
+ _If Player 1's draw matches Player 2's draw, then assign the winner as a tie._
+ _Otherwise, cycle through each option for both Players, stating who wins in each instance._
+ _Report the results of Player 1's draw, Player 2's draw, and the winner to the page._
